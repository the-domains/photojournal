I'll break it down by platform for ease of reference:</p><p>- 500px: Amazing images here. If I'm ever looking for some quick inspiration I know I'll find it here. Although they've introduced discussion forums in the last year, I've found them to be mostly full of people attempting to drum up likes and clicks on their photos and to be empty of any real information or discussion.</p><p>- Instagram: Some extremely talented photographers on here with some amazing images, if you can filter past the gym selfies, food selfies, and cat selfies. Everyone has a phone these days and most of those people are uploading to their instagram account. If you can sift through the noise there is some incredible inspirational work on here.</p><p>- Flickr: Once the be all and end all, these days I won't bother to spend much time here. The exception is the discussion forums, which exist for almost any aspect of photography that interests you and can be incredibly useful to learn and to troubleshoot your camera.</p><p>- Pinterest: Great for lifestyle imagery, although I find it more product oriented than artful. Good for a browse and for the creation of mood boards, but I don't tend to spend too much time here.</p><p>- Tumblr: Like Instagram, some amazing work if you can sift through the noise.</p><p>- VSCO: Initially a software company providing film emulation presets for Lightroom, VSCO launched their own version of Instagram a few years back. There's some great work being produced here and curated feeds are published frequently to highlight some of the best imagery on this network. There's a thematic feel to the work shown here however due to all the images being processed with VSCO products, but if you're into the fake film look - which still seems to be very big these days - this site has some great inspiration.</p><p>- Wordpress: I used a Wordpress blog for a 365 project a couple of years back. It was a great way to get in touch with people undertaking similar projects and to keep the drive up to soldier through the year by seeing what others were shooting. I kind of lost interest once I completed the project as other sites had more to offer.</p><p>- Facebook: A lot of people swear by Facebook for photographic inspiration. I tend to lock my account down as far as possible and only occasionally check it these days. I have joined a couple of local photo groups and have seen a lot of very impressive work on these networks.</p><p>- Behance: Some amazing work on here. Some of the best working photographers showcasing the best of their work. Hard not to be inspired by the work on show here.</p><p>These are the sites that I've spent some time exploring. I'm sure there's many others out there, but social media can be a rabbit hole - you don't want to follow too far down.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">Inspiration</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
