I like lighting, even though I have minimal lighting equipment and no light modifiers, after stumbling across David Hobby's Strobist blog a couple of years back, so thought it would be good to employ some light in the image. I'm a fan of black and white imagery, so thought this could be a good way to go for this shot.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-v_ArticleTitleGhosted-5214ca81-d7b3-4784-b22d-a27b81c63179" class="Section Section--components-1 no-padding title-size-large color-bg color-title section-bgcover-and section-height-fullscreen  text-align-center  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="158"><div class="Component p-1 ms-p-8 d-f fx-c j-c-between a-i-center pos-r " data-reactid="159"><div class="Bg ov-h ms-w-50p op-30 op-30" data-reactid="160"><div class="Cover min-h-80px" data-reactid="161"><img class="color-loading" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/efe067a5c66b1dc2a5121b0cfaa4b01a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F397ef4cd9d2bdd330b023060012e03b5156acef1.jpg&amp;width=900" style="object-position:73.77777777777777% 64.55555555555556%;" data-reactid="162"/></div></div><div class="Group--column p-1 ms-p-2 color-title pos-r max-w-560px ms-w-50p" data-reactid="163"><a href="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/efe067a5c66b1dc2a5121b0cfaa4b01a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F397ef4cd9d2bdd330b023060012e03b5156acef1.jpg&amp;width=900" class=" " data-reactid="164"><div class="Cover" data-reactid="165"><img class="color-loading" data-width="900" data-height="450" data-ratio="2" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/efe067a5c66b1dc2a5121b0cfaa4b01a/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fthe-grid-img%2Fp%2F397ef4cd9d2bdd330b023060012e03b5156acef1.jpg&amp;width=900" style="object-position:73.77777777777777% 64.55555555555556%;" data-reactid="166"/></div></a><!-- react-empty: 167 --><!-- react-empty: 168 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="169"><h1 data-reactid="170"><span class="" data-reactid="171"><a href="https://fstoppers.com/originals/eight-portrait-photography-rules-you-should-try-breaking-122591?utm_source=FS_RSS&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=Main_RSS" class="font-title " data-reactid="172">Eight Portrait Photography Rules You Should Try Breaking | Fstoppers</a></span></h1></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual2col-eb4e4cc8-b409-4764-afe9-c0d19261b3f5" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-vibrant colors-global " data-reactid="173"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="174"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 m-a" data-reactid="175"><div class="System-font m-a Headline" data-reactid="176"><h1 data-reactid="177"><span class="" data-reactid="178"><span class="font-title" data-reactid="179">Map of my Mind</span></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 180 --></div><!-- react-empty: 181 --><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 ms-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="182"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="183"><p>We're examining the personal 'self' this week - how to reflect your own persona in an image.
