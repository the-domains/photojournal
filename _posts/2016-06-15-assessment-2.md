Assessment 2 for the UTas Photography and Social Media course is due.

I had so many different plans for this assignment ranging from stitched landscapes, black and white, animals, and film photography. In the end it was playing around with some apps on my phone that generated my theme and final seven images.

The idea for the assessment was images for a social world. It should take the form of a visual theme - travel, landscapes, colours, moods, anything that could be tied together. Seven images should be submitted to present this theme.

Despite my initial intentions to pursue standard photographic subjects I ended up following a theme of abstraction. Using long exposures, I captured blurred images of scenery, processed and made colour corrections, twisted and contorted them into circles, and applied textures to the final product. Each image displayed different colours depending on the scene captured - green grass, blue skies, overcast white skies, orange and brown bush, blue water.

Here are my seven images on the theme of abstraction, culled from a much larger image pool to provide a sample of colour and texture:

These are not at all the photos I planned to put together when I started this photography course - the incredible landscapes and powerful portraits I had intended to try to create never came to fruition. However, I found the process of creating these images enjoyable and the final output pleasing to my eye, and to me that is the main pursuit of photography. To make something pleasing to the eye and to have fun doing so.
