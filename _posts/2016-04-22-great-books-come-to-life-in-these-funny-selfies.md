A creative take on thematic self portraiture with great lighting 

<article style=""><h1>Great Books Come to Life in these Funny Selfies</h1><p>We can't help but share this photo series we stumbled upon, shot by a voracious reader on 500px who took his love for books, photography, and selfies to new levels of awesome. With creativity and some digital magic, photographer and artist Pierre Beteille has created a unique series of self-portraits that never fails to amuse and inspire.</p><img src="https://iso.500px.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/5-1.jpg" /></article>
