I had a look at composites this week - a play at putting together various pieces of my self to make the whole. This was nine different shots taken with varied lighting and focal points, blended together to create a final image. I was thinking of creating a follow up image with varied expressions to reflect different aspects of my self.

It was interesting putting this together - the way that modifying the dimensions and spacing of elements of your face creates someone entirely different from the way you usually look.

I was a bit rushed in putting this together so there are blending issues around the neck and ear. The different exposures were maintained, rather than blended, to highlight the fact they were from different frames.
