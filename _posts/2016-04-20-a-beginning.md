A beginning...

This mini site is the beginning of my photo journal, created for my involvement in the Photography and Social Media course at the University of Tasmania. I'm undertaking the unit externally this semester in an effort to shake off my photographic cobwebs.

I've had a fascination for photography for many years, starting with snapshots with a point and shoot camera, moving to a DSLR, taking a step back in time to old film cameras, roaming with a mobile phone camera, and more recently exploring the compromise of mirrorless cameras.

Along with some new years resolutions that will never be fulfilled (I'm looking at you, gym membership), I made a vow to try to more fully explore my interest in photography this year.
