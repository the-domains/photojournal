# Why?

Today we were asked, "Why do we take photos?". It's a good question and for me there's a few answers there.

I take photos to document - to record my family growing up around me, to retain memories of events and occurrences.

I take photos to create. I'm not particularly handy with a pencil or brush. I can't create statues or sculptures with my hand. But I can point a lens in the direction of something that I find interesting. I can manipulate a few dials and line up elements of interest to create a scene that I'd like to view again. Photography is an opportunity for me to create something interesting for myself and to share what I saw with others.

I don't take photos to make money. I have a job that I enjoy, and I think if I relied on selling photos to make my living that the pressure to perform could reduce the enjoyment of photo taking. 

I don't take photos to receive likes or comments. While I like to receive positive feedback or constructive criticism as much as the next person, I'm more than aware of the pointlessness of chasing popularity on social media.

So that's why I take photos. To record, and to create.
