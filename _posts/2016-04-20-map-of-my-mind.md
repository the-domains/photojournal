# Map of my Mind

We're examining the personal 'self' this week - how to reflect your own persona in an image. To stimulate thoughts around this we were encouraged to create a mind map, detailing aspects of ourselves that can be explored photographically. 

Being a bit of a private person, I won't be posting the details of my own exploration but I'll be reviewing my images in the coming weeks to see if they reflect the concepts identified in this document.
