## Creative Selfies

We were provided a sample of imagery of creative self-portraits from previous students in the course and asked to determine which of them we found inspiring, and if they raised an idea we'd like to try.

The following two images captured my interest:

I liked the feeling of motion in the first image, the feeling that it provided of riding public transport. I'm starting to become a fan of the off-camera view to create interest as to what is happening outside of frame.

I liked the concept of the second image with partial capture of the subject. The empty space is an interesting use of frame, and the line of the nose moved the viewers eye into frame, however I feel that if the subject's other eye was illuminated it would have provided a better flow through the image, keeping the viewer's gaze in the intersecting thirds rather than the centre of the frame. The window light with the single strobe has lit the face well but the eye appears a little dull with the catchlights on the edge.

I'll be trying out a version of the eye image as my next entry for this activity.
