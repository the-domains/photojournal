# Self Portrait - take 2

A further exploration of self portraiture, this week was a continuation of the assessment from last week. The result, this:

I've usually got a goofy grin in pictures so was trying for a serious look this week. After a black and white image last week I wanted to try my hand at something with a bit of colour. I was aiming for calming colours so tried to offset the blue of the beanie, shirt, and eyes with a leafy green foliage background. A long lens and small aperture was selected to blur the background. A couple of torches were used for lighting, and a symmetrical square crop used to reinforce the calming colours.

I think the torches are too bright here as they've cast shadows on either side of my nose. A piece of paper to diffuse the beam could have prevented this - will try that next time. Shadows under the chin seem too dark again. I'll be swinging past Bunnings later in the week to pick up a cheapo home-brew reflector to fix this on next week's image.
