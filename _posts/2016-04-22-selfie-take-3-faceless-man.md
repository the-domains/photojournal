Exploring the idea of a selfie without revealing the self - kind of a faceless man thing.

I have difficulty reconciling the posting of images of the self into the digital world. I appreciate the use of the selfie as a tool to document personal change, but the potential for them to be used for illicit purposes is always at the back of mind. The ability to do both - to create an image of yourself while minimising the transmission of personal details is one I find interesting, and which guided this week's image.

Two lights were used again this week, located behind my head on a 45 degree angle each side to provide some light to the sides of my head but keep my face in darkness. A smallish aperture (~f/11) was used to control the strength of the lights as they were close to my head (and blew the highlights above f/5) and a fast shutter speed (1/500sec with a leaf shutter) used to make the ugly garage door behind me turn black. 

I used a piece of white board that I picked up for $5 from Bunnings as a reflector and leant it against the tripod in front of me to provide a little reflection under my chin and onto my neck. If I had one, I would have used a third light behind me to provide a little rim light to the top of my head. I considered converting the image to black and white but felt the muted skin tones added something that the b&w lacked.
