Week 5 - Photo Editing

This image was taken in the Brisbane town hall last week, but I couldn't settle on which final version I preferred. The pic is of a couple of business types walking towards the exit of the building. I was drawn to the symmetry and styling of the building and wanted to use it as a backdrop for something. I dragged the shutter and waited for a someone to walk through the frame. These were the only two people who weren't surrounded by a mass of others and so offered the least cluttered frame.

Here's the progression and final options:

Original Image:

From there I wasn't sure where to take it... black and white?

I liked the emphasis of the two figures moving through the frame towards the exit in the last image but the extreme distortion of the foreground left me a bit cold.
