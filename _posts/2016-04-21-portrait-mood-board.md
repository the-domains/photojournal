An activity this week was to create a mood board to help establish a brand for your own work. I pulled together some imagery from photographers whose portrait work I've admired for some time and created a mood board at the following location:

Browsing these images I've found some commonalities between them, a direction I hope my images of people will progress towards. Some of these recurring elements are:

- studio lighting with an emphasis on the use of hard light,

- muted pastel colours or black and white,

- headshots/upper body images with a gaze directly on camera or slightly out of frame
