Photo Assessment 2:

This image is not a continuation of the self portrait theme from assessment 1\. For this assessment we need to produce seven images to communicate a visual theme or story. I'm playing with the idea of a series of Zoo portraits - I just need to decide a unifying theme to tie them together (other than the whole locked up in cages thing).

I've seen a few really well executed series of zoo portraits lately (see the links in the previous posts) and just need to settle on something for this set.

This guy's expression conveys how I feel about this right now.
