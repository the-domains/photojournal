We've been looking at analysing photos this week. Here's a run down of an image I took this week at the beach...

Content:

The picture is of sand dunes in late afternoon light. It shows the last light of the day being encroached upon by the approaching sunset.

Composition & Technique:

A fast shutter speed was used to provide detail to the middle of the image, while keeping shadows in the upper portion. A moderate aperture kept the centre of the image in focus while allowing the foreground and far background slowly move out of focus. A filter was used on the lens to darken the sky and provide a light gradient to the light of the sand. Leading lines in the dunes lead the eye to the upper right portion of the frame to negative space. If the sun had been willing it would have resolved nicely to have the setting sun behind the dark dune. I considered adding flare in post but it wouldn't have sat right with the shadows created on the dunes.

Context:

I liked the hard light against the dunes and the shadows they created. A few shots were taken at different angles and heights until I settled on this as the lines led the eye into the photo better. You could interpret the inevitability of the dark consuming the light, but I just liked the shadows that were here.

Connection:

The black and white processing and strong contrast is a reflection of one of my favourite film stocks - trix 400\.
