# Selfie - take 1

The first assessment of this course is to identify how you represent yourself online, through a selfie, self-portrait, or brand. 

I'm not a selfie kind of guy so this isn't an easy challenge for me. I'm not shooting professionally so didn't feel the representation of brand is all that relevant to me, but I thought about what I like in photography and how I could convey that within an image of myself. I like lighting, even though I have minimal lighting equipment and no light modifiers, after stumbling across David Hobby's Strobist blog a couple of years back, so thought it would be good to employ some light in the image. I'm a fan of black and white imagery, so thought this could be a good way to go for this shot.

The assessment poses the question how will your image make you stand out from the competition. Honestly, I don't yet know the answer to that one. I have minimal experience in portrait photography and even less in selfies. At this point I'm just aiming to create some interesting portraits of myself and maybe I'll discover some unique aspect to my pictures along the way.

With that in mind, here's take 1 of my self-portrait assessment:

I was going for the feel of emerging from the darkness of non-selfiedom here. A fast shutter speed and two torches either side of me were used for lighting and to darken the white blind behind me. I've positioned myself off-center to add an element of tension to reflect the discomfort I had in taking this shot and used black and white to meet the tone of the black background (and because I like black and white images). I think I could improve upon the image by a adding a reflector under my chin to bounce some light and lighten the shadows.
